# .emacs.d/

My emacs config is based on [the literate programming fork of the
Original Emacs Starter Kit](https://github.com/eschulte/emacs24-starter-kit) with the following changes:

* it's not literate
* it doesn't install org at all
* it uses [evil-mode](https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil)

Essentially, I wanted a stripped down version that was easy to
understand what was being installed and executed.
