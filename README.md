dotfiles
========

I typically clone this repo to `.dotfiles`.

I also have a directory `.dotprivate` which stores things that are
incompatible with a public repo. I also manage these with git for sanity
purposes, but they don't get pushed here. At some point I may create
templatized versions of those.
